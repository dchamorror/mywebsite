I'm Danilo Chamorro Riascos, currently an M.Sc. candidate at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in the Earth Sciences and Engineering division, with a special focus on **Machine Learning**. My academic and professional journey intertwines the rigors of geological engineering with the innovative realm of data science.

My academic path started at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where I graduated Summa cum Laude in Geological Engineering. This provided a solid foundation for my ongoing research and studies, which include the application of Machine Learning to geosciences, particularly in seismic data interpretation. My commitment to lifelong learning is matched by my enthusiasm for contributing to the advancement of geophysical studies, as evidenced by my active participation in academic communities including the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (EAGE) and Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG).

My research interests and professional pursuits are firmly rooted in the integration of geophysics and data science, aiming to contribute innovative solutions to the challenges in earth sciences. I am always open to discussions, collaborations, and opportunities that explore new horizons in this fascinating field.
